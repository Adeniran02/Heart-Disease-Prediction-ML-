# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML-
Hello There, My new project is now Live...

For many years, Heart disease has been a prevalent cause of mortality among many, both the young and old. This project supports various intervention programs led by data scientists to tackle this ailment globally. One key factor, however, has remained constant: that isâ€¦"Early detection can save lives." For this project, I built a machine-learning model that predicts a patient's risk of heart disease using historical medical data. By uncovering patterns in vital health indicators like age, chest pain type, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, exercise responses, and many others, I hope it can assist healthcare providers with timely, data-driven decisions, with the goal of transforming patient care and saving lives. 

I hope it's helpful -):
